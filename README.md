# Snake Game Project

This is a classic Snake game recreation built in **Python** using the built-in `turtle` graphics module. It features clean object-oriented structure, real-time keyboard controls, collision detection, and scoring. The game is simple to play but demonstrates core computer science concepts like state management, loops, and modularity.
